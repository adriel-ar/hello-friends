# hello-friends

Hi.  
For a while now I have been studying data science and while I still find it very interesting, I don't see myself enjoying a career in it. Therefore, 
I have decided to go back and focus on web development but in doing so I am purposefully starting from step 1 in order to ensure that I have a solid foundation. 

Please feel free to offer any advice, critiques, ideas, etc in regards to the work that I upload onto github. The main purpose for sharing this repository is to learn as much as possible and opinions from people already working in the tech industry are valuable to me. Given how shaky things seem to be in the states in terms of job prospects, economy, etc, I decided to actively devote my free time to learning and mastering web development once and for all so that I have flexibility to handle anything that may come up in life. 

Tentative Learning Path (Based on the web development bootcamp I have)

  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. Bootstrap 4
  4. Javascript
  5. DOM Manipulation
  6. jQuery
  7. Bash Command Line
  8. Node.JS
  9. Express.js
  10. REST
  11. APIs
  12. Databases
  13. SQL
  14. MongoDB
  15. Mongoose
  16. Authentication
  17. Firebase
  18. React.js
  19. React Hooks
  20. Web Design
  21. Deployment with GitHub Pages, Heroku and MongoDB Atlas

As I progress through each module, I'll update this page with a mark on each section that has been completed. Time to get to work!
